Questions solved are :













Easy 1 :
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.


Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"

Output: 5

Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.


Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "

Output: 4

Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.


Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"

Output: 6

Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.


 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104

s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.

There will be at least one word in s.

Medium 2:
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]

Output: [3]


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: [1]


Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2]

Output: [1,2]


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104

-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Hard 3:

Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.



Example 1:

Input: n = 13

Output: 6


Example 2:

Input: n = 0

Output: 0

 
Constraints:

0 <= n <= 109
